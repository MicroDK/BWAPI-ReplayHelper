# ReplayHelper

This tool can be used to replay Broodwar games with BWAPI. It includes an auto observer and has game and player information areas that can be toggle on and off.
It is forked from the AIIDE Tournament Manager and has been changed to an AI module to be able to send text commands. The tool has been tested with BWAPI 4.4 but has not been tested with older BWAPI versions.
